The Object Detection Metrics are pre theorized in a way that is different that our understanding. Following the guidelines, the output is generated. The number of TP, FP, FN doesnot indicate the total number of images when added. They are just based on the annotations and results .csv files which contain images with multiple annotations and theor corresponding dimensions. Printing the TP, FP nad FN are also enabled and would be further established. But the models are currently working well as needed. The Updated_Obj_det.ipynb file consists TP, FP, FB calculations and corresponding output as a file.
